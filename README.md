# EDCSProject
The EDCS project is meant to be the file system for the new webservice that EDCS has commissioned. 
Every comment and file name shall be written in English. 
Making the code readable is important. This include code identation, sensible names etc. 
The file names should have logical names that describe their function. 
Necessary documentation for code files will be added as the project proceeds. 
Nothing should be added to the main branch until merge. 
Every week has its own branch and every issue has its own branch based on the weekly branch. 
A review is necessary for an issues pull request to be merged. 
Deleting code should be avoided as much as possible.
